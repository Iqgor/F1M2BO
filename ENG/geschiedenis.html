                When the Rijksmuseum opened its doors two centuries ago, it was not in Amsterdam. Where then?
                And what did Napoleon have to do with the move?
                The history of the Rijksmuseum reads like an exciting book.
            </p>
            <h3>How it began</h3>
            <p>
                On November 19, 1798, the government decided to set up a national museum following the French example.
                A 'prestige project' to stimulate the love for the country but also to preserve important objects
                keep.
                On May 31, 1800, this National Art Gallery opened its doors for the first time in Huis Ten Bosch in Den
                Hedge. With over 200 paintings and historical objects,
                partly from the stadholder's collections and partly from (discontinued) national institutions, such as the VOC.
                The first purchase, De Zwaan by Jan Asselijn, cost 100 guilders and is still one of the masterpieces
                of the National Museum.
            </p>
            <h3>Het 'koninklijk museum'</h3>
            <p>
                In 1808 Lodewijk Napoleon was at the helm of the Kingdom of Holland.
                He moved the collections to Amsterdam, the new capital.
                And not to just any building, but to the Paleis op de Dam, the former Amsterdam city hall.
                There they were brought together with the most important paintings of the city, including the Night Watch of
                Rembrandt.
                In 1809 the Royal Museum opened on the top floor of the palace.
            </p>
            <h3>Het 'Rijks Museum'</h3>
            <p>
                With Willem I as new king from 1813, the museum moved as 'Rijks Museum' together with the from Den
                The Hague-originated national print collection to the Trippenhuis,
                a 17th-century city palace on the Kloveniersburgwal.
                To the director's dismay, all kinds of other collections were subsequently relocated.
                Objects from classical antiquity went to a new Museum of Antiquities in Leiden and objects and
                applied arts were assigned to the Cabinet of Rarities, which had meanwhile been established in The Hague.
                In 1838 a separate museum for modern, 19th-century art was opened in Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.
                In contrast to the Napoleonic era, the Rijks Museum received few large works.
